build!: update input fields & fetch wells using water-depth

# [optional body]
BREAKING CHANGE: the data-fields "Offshore,Mexico,Cuba," were deprecated
and removed from `d0` input-files.

- Pattern-matching used w/ those fields no longer supported
  (i.e. {grep '^,,,'...} and {grep '^y,'...} )
- USE-INSTEAD: Water-Depth {==0} & {!=0} to fetch onshore vs offshore wells

- Format of `d0` files generated before this now considered legacy
--> Backward-compatibility will not be supported
- MIGRATE/FIX: Manually update legacy `d0` files to reuse
- -OR- Request getting new `d0` files generated for those wells
