build!: update input fields & fetch wells using water-depth

# [optional body]
BREAKING CHANGE: the data-fields "Offshore,Mexico,Cuba," were deprecated
and removed from `d0` input-files.

- Pattern-matching used w/ those fields no longer supported
  i.e. {grep '^y,'...} and {grep '^,,,'...}
- Use water-depth "!=0" & "==0" to fetch offshore vs onshore wells instead

- Format of `d0` files generated before this now considered legacy,
  and backward-compatibility will not supported
- Update legacy `d0` files manually to reuse
- -OR- request updated `d0` files be generated for those wells
